### 1. Uber: Leading engineering through an agentic shift

**Speakers:** Anshu Chada (Dev Platform lead, Uber), Ty Smith (Principal Engineer, Uber)
**Published:** The Pragmatic Engineer, March 10, 2026
**Format:** 37-minute conference talk (The Pragmatic Summit)
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1tZN41VKcE
**Transcript:** `../Resources/uber-agentic-shift-transcript.txt`

**Project-tuned summary:** Uber's account of shifting from "pair programming" (GitHub Copilot tab completion, ~10–15% velocity gain, 2022–23) to "peer programming" (agentic AI running asynchronously, 2025–26). As of March 2026: 84% of Uber developers are agentic coding users; 65–72% of code is AI-generated inside IDE tools; Claude Code usage nearly doubled in three months (32% Dec 2025 → 63% Feb 2026). The talk distinguishes the productivity gains from the organizational problems they surfaced: as AI-generated diffs multiplied, code review became a bottleneck, requiring Uber to build internal tooling (Code Inbox, U Review) to manage review load and smart assignment. The "peer programming" framing — developers acting as tech leads directing AI agents — is strong candidate language for the maturity model's upper levels. The talk also covers organizational and cultural challenges, developer anxiety, measurement, and cost governance.

**Key data points:**
- 84% of devs are agentic coding users (March 2026)
- 65–72% of code AI-generated in IDE tools; 100% for CLI agents like Claude Code
- Copilot-era gain: ~10–15% diff velocity; agentic-era gains described as qualitatively different
- Primary agent use cases: dead code cleanup, library migrations, bug fixes, writing docs
- New bottleneck created at scale: code review — more PRs, faster generation, review quality at risk
- Internal tools built in response: Code Inbox (unified PR inbox, smart assignment, SLOs) and U Review (AI-assisted review)
- CEO framing: "AI is enabling people to become superhumans in terms of their productivity"

**Relevance to maturity model:** Primary case study for Level 4–5 (Integrated / Compounding). Illustrates both what high-maturity adoption looks like operationally and what new failure modes it surfaces. The code review bottleneck is a strong candidate for the Level 4 characteristic tension. The peer programming model and developer-as-tech-lead framing are candidate language for upper-level descriptions.

### 2. How Uber uses AI for development: inside look

**Author:** Gergely Orosz (The Pragmatic Engineer newsletter)
**Published:** March 10–11, 2026
**Format:** Newsletter article (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/How Uber uses AI for development_ inside look.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** The written companion to entry 1 (the Pragmatic Summit talk), with additional data and architecture detail. Orosz documents Uber's four-layer AI platform: internal ML platform (Michelangelo-based) → internal context layer (code, docs, Slack, JIRA) → industry agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex) → specialized agents (test generation, code review). Key internal tools built: Minion (background agent platform), Shepherd (migration management, handles large-scale codebase changes), Autocover (generates 5,000+ unit tests/month), Code Inbox (smart PR routing with SLOs and Slack batching), U Review (AI-assisted code review). AI-related costs are up 6x since 2024; token cost optimization is a growing operational priority. The article also documents the organizational friction: 92% of devs use agents monthly, 11% of PRs are opened by agents — and the code review queue has become the primary bottleneck as a result.

**Key data points:**
- 84% of devs are agentic coding users; 92% use agents monthly
- 11% of PRs opened by agents (as of March 2026)
- Claude Code usage: 32% of devs in Dec 2025 → 63% in Feb 2026
- AI costs up 6x since 2024; cost governance is now a first-class problem
- Internal tools purpose-built for the agentic era: Minion, Shepherd, Autocover, Code Inbox, U Review

**Relevance to maturity model:** The most data-rich case study available for Level 4–5. The four-layer platform architecture, the cost governance challenge, and the code review bottleneck are all characteristic of high-maturity adoption. The internal tooling investment is itself evidence of a Level 4 organization: they have stopped relying on off-the-shelf tooling and are designing their own AI-native workflows.

### 3. Why Does AI Development Look Like 1980s Software Planning?

**Author:** Sachin Benny (Summer Lightning newsletter)
**Published:** November 16, 2025
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/Why Does AI Development Look Like 1980s Software Planning_.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Argues that the return of waterfall-style planning in AI development is not a cultural regression but a rational response to changed communication costs. The core claim, drawn from Coase's theory of the firm and communication structure theory: agile emerged when digital tools made rapid iteration cheaper than documentation; LLMs flip this cost structure because ontological drift — mid-cycle redefinition of concepts that AI systems depend on — becomes extremely expensive. Organizations compensate by freezing definitions upfront, front-loading specification, and minimizing reinterpretation cycles. Conway's Law applied: LLM-driven systems impose a waterfall-like communication structure on the teams building them. The Boom Supersonic mkBoom case is used as a counterexample: rapid iteration works there because the ontology (wing sweep, drag polars, thrust curves) is already highly stable.

**Key claims:**
- Agile = low-cost communication = cheap iteration; Waterfall = high documentation cost = front-load clarity
- LLMs make documentation essentially free but make ontological drift extremely expensive — shifting the cost structure back toward waterfall
- Conway's Law: the communication structure of the system determines the communication structure of the organization building it
- New product development requires ontology invention from scratch — this is inherently waterfall-phase work
- Stable domains (existing engineering ontologies like aviation) can benefit from rapid AI iteration; novel domains cannot

**Relevance to maturity model:** Directly relevant to the governance framing. The "ontological drift" concept is a precise name for a failure mode at lower maturity levels: organizations that adopt agentic AI without stabilizing definitions, roles, and process handoffs experience cascading reinterpretation failures. The article's framework helps explain why a protocol-framed maturity model is different from a tooling-adoption model — the protocol layer (stable definitions, coordination rules) is what makes fast AI iteration possible, not the other way around.

### 4. The Hottest Job in Tech

**Author:** Evan Armstrong (The Leverage newsletter)
**Published:** August 5, 2025
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/The Hottest Job in Tech - by Evan Armstrong - The Leverage.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Documents the boom in Forward Deployed Engineers as a symptom of AI being a larger platform shift than cloud. The core claim: AI requires customers to reimagine staffing, workflows, and management structures — bigger organizational change than cloud migration — and FDEs provide the implementation support that makes adoption actually happen. Includes pricing analysis: FDEs are economically viable only at high ACV ($1M+ contracts, or $250–300K ACV with usage-based pricing growth), which concentrates them at the enterprise/hyperscaler end of the market. Historical parallel: Workday's 2012 IPO had 35% revenue from on-site professional services (cloud data migration); investors disliked it but it proved essential for long-term stickiness. Also documents non-technical FDE roles: Runway sends "creatives" (not engineers) to ad agencies to reimagine AI-native workflows from scratch.

**Key data points:**
- OpenAI deploys FDEs to customers spending $10M+/year
- Typical FDE cost: $200–300K salary; services rule of thumb ≤25% of Year-1 contract value → $1M+ contract floor
- Workday 2012: 35% revenue from professional services at IPO
- Non-technical FDEs emerging: Runway deploys creative professionals for workflow reimagination, not just implementation

**Relevance to maturity model:** The FDE model is a Level 2→3 transition enabler: organizations stuck in sanctioned-but-uncoordinated AI use often need an embedded partner to design the workflow changes that let AI capability compound. The article's platform shift thesis frames why the transition from Level 2 to 3 requires deliberate design rather than organic adoption. The non-technical FDE variant (Runway's creatives) suggests the maturity model needs to address non-engineering departments, not just dev teams.

### 5. How to Build Your Forward Deployed Engineering Team

**Author:** Mark Scianna (Per Aspera / Forward Deployed Venture Capital)
**Published:** September 17, 2025
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/How to Build Your Forward Deployed Engineering Team.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Practitioner guide to building an FDE function, based on Scianna's experience at Palantir. Four rules: (1) FDEs must be real engineers who ship in days-to-weeks; (2) commitment must be sustained weeks-long deployments, not short visits; (3) FDEs must have Auftragstaktik autonomy (HQ sets objectives, field decides tactics); (4) field discoveries must feed back into platform features — if custom work just accumulates, you're running a services business. The "gravel road" concept: build the minimum viable path to a customer outcome in ≤10 days, using live data. Echo role (domain insider, relationship management) + Delta role (rapid prototyping) as the team structure. The economic sustainability test: if revenue-per-FDE is growing and custom work is abstracting into platform features, FDE is working. If not, you're a consultancy.

**Key concepts:**
- Auftragstaktik: mission-based autonomy where field teams execute without permission-seeking
- Gravel road: minimum viable path to working outcome, built in ≤10 days with real customer data
- Demo-as-spec: the live working demo replaces written requirements
- Echo + Delta roles: domain expert + rapid prototyper
- The platform feedback test: custom work → platform abstraction is the only sustainable FDE economics

**Relevance to maturity model:** The Auftragstaktik and demo-as-spec concepts map to the Level 3→4 transition in the maturity model: organizations that are governed (policies exist) but not yet integrated (AI workflows are designed) often fail because implementation authority is too centralized. The gravel road concept is a practical tool for Level 2 organizations trying to identify their first AI workflow worth formalizing.

### 6. WTF is a Forward-Deployed Engineer?

**Author:** Thomas Otter (Work in Progress newsletter)
**Published:** April 21, 2025
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/WTF is a forward-deployed engineer_.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** A skeptical accounting of the FDE trend, arguing it is primarily a re-labeling of technical implementation consulting and the relevant question is financial categorization, not job title. If FDE work is invoiced to customers, it's consulting (COGS/services revenue). If not, it's customer success (still COGS, not R&D). Calling either ARR is misleading. Long-term risk: if your strongest technical people are project-facing, you struggle to build a standard product; after years you have dozens of one-off implementations but a weak platform, and internal standardization efforts produce civil war as customers and consultants resist. Historical precedent: SAP built much of R/1 on customer sites in the 1970s; this model predates the Palantir mythology.

**Key claims:**
- FDE is a job title, not a methodology; the methodology is technical implementation consulting
- The real question is accounting: services revenue vs. R&D investment vs. ARR
- If FDEs > product engineers, you're a services company
- Long-term platform risk: custom implementations accumulate; standardization becomes politically impossible
- Time-track FDE work; recognize it correctly in financials

**Relevance to maturity model:** The financial discipline argument maps to a governance failure at Level 3: organizations that deploy AI implementation support (internal or external) without tracking costs against value will not be able to measure ROI, cannot make resource allocation decisions, and tend to stay stuck. The services-vs-product distinction is directly analogous to the Level 3→4 distinction between AI that is governed but project-specific vs. AI that is integrated into standard workflows.

## Category: Iteration methodology and case studies (Boom Supersonic)

*Note: The Boom Supersonic series by Blake Scholl is not directly about AI adoption. It is included because it provides unusually precise language for iteration philosophy, organizational design, and the relationship between tooling and capability — concepts that inform the maturity model's upper levels and the protocol framing.*

### 7. Move fast and don't break (safety critical) things [Part 1]

**Author:** Blake Scholl (CEO, Boom Supersonic)
**Published:** August 10, 2025
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/Move fast and don't break (safety critical) things.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** How Boom built XB-1 (first independently developed supersonic jet) with 50 people and ~$190M — an order of magnitude better than traditional aerospace programs. The key lever: embedding software engineers in hardware teams and building mkBoom, a proprietary airplane design tool that automates full aircraft analysis from a parametric config file. **Jevons's Law of engineering**: when iteration becomes cheap, many more designs can be explored, and qualitatively better designs emerge that would never have been attempted under high-iteration-cost conditions. The seating/fuselage example: a redesign that appeared to cost 1,000 miles of range proved recoverable through mkBoom iteration, ultimately unlocking "Boomless Cruise" as a side effect.

**Relevance to maturity model:** The Jevons's Law framing is the clearest articulation available of why Level 5 (Compounding) is qualitatively different from Level 4 (Integrated): it's not faster execution of the same decisions, it's a change in the decision space. Organizations that reach Level 5 explore design options that were previously unaffordable to consider. The mkBoom architecture — stable ontology + rapid iteration = qualitatively new capabilities — is the hardware analog of what high-maturity AI adoption enables in knowledge work.

### 8. Move Fast and Don't Break (safety critical) Things Part 2: Vertical Integration

**Author:** Blake Scholl (CEO, Boom Supersonic)
**Published:** September 14, 2025
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/Move Fast and Don't Break (safety critical) Things Part 2_ Vertical Integration.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Introduces the **Slacker Index** (total lead time ÷ actual working time) as a diagnostic for iteration bottlenecks. Two case studies: (1) XB-1 damper actuator: $60K/unit, 52-week lead time; the team froze iteration on the last spare, costing 6 weeks across the program. (2) Symphony engine turbine blades: $1M per engine with 6-month lead time; discovered a $2M 3D printer with 2-week delivery that produces blades in 24 hours. The printer paid for itself in one set of blades; iterations are now daily instead of semi-annual.

**Key concepts:**
- Slacker Index = total lead time ÷ working time (a ratio of waste)
- Problems that are unsolvable with year-long iteration cycles become tractable at 24-hour cycles
- Vertical integration collapses lead time; enables risk-taking and fast failure
- Hardware development can look like agile software development when lead times are compressed

**Relevance to maturity model:** The Slacker Index is a transferable diagnostic for AI adoption. The equivalent in knowledge work: total cycle time to get a decision made using AI ÷ actual AI working time. Most Level 2–3 organizations have enormous Slacker Indexes on AI workflows — the AI does its task in seconds but the approval, review, and integration process adds days. The Level 3→4 transition is largely about collapsing this ratio.

### 9. Building a Safety Culture: Move And Don't Break Safety Critical Things, Part III

**Author:** Blake Scholl (CEO, Boom Supersonic)
**Published:** March 15, 2026
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/Building a Safety Culture_ Move And Don't Break Safety Critical Things, Part III.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Argues that safety culture in high-stakes development requires treating near-misses as real incidents, building transparent (not anonymous) reporting systems, and investing in extensive rehearsal before deployment. The key distinction: anonymous safety reporting systems reduce signal quality; trust-based transparent cultures produce better incident data because people report more precisely when they know the response will be constructive. Extensive pre-deployment rehearsal (simulator hours, ground tests, telemetry walkthroughs) creates the competency needed to respond correctly when anomalies occur in the field.

**Relevance to maturity model:** The near-miss culture and transparent reporting arguments translate directly to AI governance at Level 3–4. Organizations at Level 3 typically have policies but no feedback loops: AI errors are handled ad hoc, not fed back into protocol improvements. A Level 4 characteristic is that AI failures — hallucinations, wrong outputs, process errors — are treated as near-misses to be analyzed, not embarrassments to be suppressed. The rehearsal argument maps to what organizations need before deploying AI in high-stakes workflows: not just testing the model, but rehearsing the human response to model failures.

### 10. Hiring: Skills vs. Aptitude

**Author:** Blake Scholl (CEO, Boom Supersonic)
**Published:** August 18, 2025
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/Hiring_ Skills vs. Aptitude - Blake Scholl.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Innovation-stage organizations should hire for aptitude (ability to learn and adapt) over skills (specific prior experience). Skills-based hiring is appropriate for stable operational roles; aptitude hiring is appropriate when the team must continuously expand into new domains. Boom's priority order: culture fit → aptitude → skills. One-page resumes are a filter for aptitude: they test whether candidates can think and communicate under constraint.

**Relevance to maturity model:** Indirectly relevant. The skills vs. aptitude distinction maps to a characteristic hiring error at Level 2: organizations that have adopted AI tools often hire "AI specialists" (skills-based) rather than people who can learn and adapt as the tooling evolves (aptitude-based). A Level 3+ organization hires for the ability to govern uncertainty, not for familiarity with specific current tools. This is a quiet but important design choice that separates organizations that compound from those that plateau.

### 11. The airplane that unlocked the supersonic age

**Author:** Blake Scholl (CEO, Boom Supersonic)
**Published:** January 28, 2026
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/The airplane that unlocked the supersonic age.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Retrospective on XB-1's achievements: first independently developed supersonic jet, 50 people, ~$190M, zero safety incidents. Key achievements: 5% drag reduction via AR vision system (vs. Concorde's droop nose), demonstrated Mach Cutoff (Boomless Cruise — sonic boom refracted away from ground via atmospheric temperature gradients), contributed to President Trump's June 2025 Executive Order legalizing supersonic flight over the US. The safety culture section is relevant: ejection seat removal (deemed net-safer) led to redundant systems and extensive pre-flight rehearsal — 20,000+ hours of data review, 80 briefing sessions, 27 full-aircraft tests before first flight.

**Relevance to maturity model:** The XB-1 program is the most complete case study available of what an organization at full capability maturity looks like: small team, high iteration velocity, software-hardware integration, safety culture with feedback loops, and Jevons's Law outcomes (designs discovered through iteration that would have been unaffordable to attempt conventionally). Useful as an analogy for describing the Level 5 (Compounding) state to readers who find the AI framing abstract.

### 12. Your aftermarket profits are my disruptor's opportunity

**Author:** Blake Scholl (CEO, Boom Supersonic)
**Published:** September 24, 2025
**Format:** Essay (PDF in Resources)
**Source file:** `../Resources/Your aftermarket profits are my disruptor's opportunity.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** S-curve theory applied to disruption: as products mature, profit pools migrate to aftermarket (services, spare parts, maintenance). This creates perverse incentives — OEMs no longer want to build better products because they'd cannibalize aftermarket revenue. The disruption opportunity: new entrants unencumbered by aftermarket dependencies attack with fresh technology on a new S-curve. Applied to AI tools: incumbent enterprise software vendors with large professional services revenue have structural incentives to slow the shift to self-service AI adoption. This is the vendor-side version of the organizational maturity problem.

**Relevance to maturity model:** The S-curve and aftermarket dependency concepts are useful for the "why organizations get stuck" analysis. Organizations often plateau at Level 2–3 not because of technical limitations but because incumbents (consultants, tool vendors, internal IT departments) have aftermarket interests in keeping adoption complex. A mature organization recognizes these incentive structures and designs around them. Useful for the "characteristic tension" at Level 2: the tension between IT/security (aftermarket-defending) and business units (trying to adopt faster).

## Category: Existing AI maturity frameworks

*Note: These frameworks are included as reference objects — what the field has produced, where it falls short, and what a protocol-framed model adds. The BCG report operates at national/economy level, not organizational. Microsoft and Accenture operate at organizational level but measure different things.*

### 13. BCG AI Maturity Matrix

**Authors:** Christian Schwaerzler et al. (Boston Consulting Group)
**Published:** November 2024
**Format:** Report PDF (13.9MB)
**Source file:** `../Resources/BCG-AI-Maturity-Matrix-2024.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** A national-level AI readiness framework, not an organizational CMM. BCG scores 73 economies across two axes: AI Readiness (via the ASPIRE index — Ambition, Skills, Policy, Investment, Research, Ecosystem) and AI Exposure (potential for disruption across sectors). The result is six economy archetypes: AI Pioneers (5 economies — US, UK, Canada, Singapore, China), Steady Contenders (24), Exposed Practitioners (27), Graduating Practitioners (23), Rising Contenders (8), and AI Emergents (7). The ASPIRE readiness dimensions are weighted: Skills and Ecosystem carry 25% each; Investment and Research carry 15% each; Ambition and Policy carry 10% each. The framework's main insight is that exposure and readiness do not correlate: high disruption potential without readiness is the most dangerous position — which applies to organizations as well as economies.

**Key data points:**
- Only 5 of 73 economies qualify as AI Pioneers
- 70%+ of economies score below midpoint on ecosystem participation, skills, and R&D
- AI use has boosted some companies' revenues by 2.5x vs. competitors
- GenAI-supported consultants perform 20% better on data science tasks; biotech firms shortened drug discovery by 25%
- Global AI spending projection: $632B by 2028 (Goldman Sachs, May 2024)
- AI exposure measurement: BCG Global Innovation Survey (30%), Quid earnings call analysis (30%), LinkedIn job postings (30%), GenAI-sourced insights (10%)

**Relevance to maturity model:** Limited direct applicability — the unit of analysis is economies, not organizations. The ASPIRE framework is interesting as a structural analogy: the six dimensions (Ambition, Skills, Policy, Investment, Research, Ecosystem) map loosely to what a mature organization needs to govern AI well. The exposure/readiness mismatch concept is directly portable: a Level 1–2 organization has high AI exposure (their competitors are using it) with low readiness (no governance protocol in place). This is the frame for the opening problem statement in both the blog post and litepaper. Cite to establish what national-level readiness frameworks look like before pivoting to why the organizational question requires a different model.

### 14. Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model

**Authors:** Mihaela Vorvoreanu, Amy Heger, Samir Passi et al. (Microsoft AETHER Committee)
**Published:** May 2023
**Format:** Whitepaper PDF (834KB)
**Source file:** `../Resources/Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Maturity-Model-2023.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** The most rigorous published AI maturity model found in this research. Built on 80+ hours of interviews and focus groups with 90+ participants (47 Microsoft internal RAI specialists + 56 external experts), following established maturity model methodology (Becker et al. 2009; De Bruin et al. 2005). The model has 24 empirically-derived dimensions organized across three interdependent categories: Organizational Foundations (Leadership/Culture + Governance + Knowledge Resources + Tooling), Team Approach (cross-discipline collaboration, UX readiness, specialist integration), and RAI Practice (accountability, transparency, risk identification and mitigation). Each dimension is rated 1–5 (Latent → Emerging → Developing → Realizing → Leading). The model's central claim: RAI maturity is not a technical problem — it requires UX researchers, designers, anthropologists, sociologists, linguists. Collaboration is identified as the core driver of maturity across all participants. Critically, the model explicitly warns against averaging scores: maturity is uneven and interdependent; a Level 5 tooling score does not compensate for Level 1 leadership.

**Key data points:**
- 24 empirically derived dimensions (not assumed)
- 90+ participants interviewed; 47 internal Microsoft RAI specialists
- Five levels: Latent → Emerging → Developing → Realizing → Leading
- Three pyramid tiers: Organizational Foundations → Team Approach → RAI Practice
- Level 1 governance: no internal RAI policies
- Level 5 governance: forward-thinking policy integrated into processes and tools; reconciled with other internal policies
- Most organizations currently below Level 5 by design — model is aspirational

**Relevance to maturity model:** The most important existing framework to engage with critically. Three things it does well: rigorous empirical derivation (not consultant heuristics), the interdependence insight (dimensions interact; you can't max one and ignore others), and the collaboration thesis (maturity requires human organizational change, not just technical deployment). The gap it leaves: the Microsoft model focuses entirely on Responsible AI — bias, transparency, fairness — not on governance of uncertainty in AI-assisted work processes more broadly. An organization can score Level 5 on the Microsoft model while still having the shadow adoption, review bottlenecks, and protocol incoherence described in entries 1–2. This is the most direct case for why the protocol-framed model is necessary.

**Project-tuned summary:** An organizational performance study of ~1,200 companies globally, measuring AI maturity on two axes: Foundation capabilities (cloud, data platforms, governance, tools) and Differentiation capabilities (strategy, culture, talent). The result is four archetypes: AI Achievers (12%), AI Builders (12%), AI Innovators (13%), AI Experimenters (63%). Achievers have both high Foundation and high Differentiation; Experimenters have neither. The performance gap is substantial: Achievers are 3.5x more likely to see AI-influenced revenue exceed 30% of total revenues and 25% more likely to scale AI pilots to production. The five success factors for Achievers: (1) CEO-level sponsorship (83% have it), (2) robust talent with cross-cutting expertise, (3) industrialized AI tools and teams (BBVA has 4,000+ custom GPTs), (4) responsible AI by design, (5) dual investment focus — immediate wins and long-term capability.

**Key data points:**
- 12% of firms are AI Achievers; 63% are AI Experimenters
- Achievers: 50% greater revenue growth (pre-pandemic 2019); 3.5x more likely to exceed 30% AI-influenced revenue
- 83% of Achievers have CEO and senior sponsorship vs. much lower for Experimenters
- 25% more likely to scale AI pilots (Achievers vs. Experimenters)
- AI-influenced revenue growth trajectory: 10% (2018) → 22% (2021) → projected 31% (2024)
- Companies dedicating 30%+ of tech budgets to AI: 19% (2021) → 49% (2024 projection)
- BBVA: 4,000+ internal custom GPTs deployed
- AI transformation happening 16 months faster than digital transformation (projected)

**Relevance to maturity model:** The Achiever/Experimenter split (12% / 63%) is the most useful empirical anchor for the "where organizations are now" section — the 63% figure maps to Level 1–2 in the working model. The Foundation + Differentiation axes offer a useful diagnostic decomposition: organizations often fail because they have one without the other (Builders have good infrastructure but poor culture; Innovators have good culture but poor infrastructure — both are stuck). The CEO sponsorship finding (83% of Achievers) is the empirical backing for why Level 3 (Governed) requires explicit leadership commitment, not just technical policy. The 25% pilot-to-production gap is empirical evidence for why Level 3 is a genuine sticking point — policies exist but integration fails.

### 16. State of Enterprise AI 2025

**Authors:** OpenAI
**Published:** 2025
**Format:** Report PDF (9.7MB)
**Source file:** `../Resources/OpenAI-State-of-Enterprise-AI-2025.pdf`
**Methodology:** De-identified, aggregated data from 1M+ business customers; survey of ~9,000 workers across ~100 enterprises

**Project-tuned summary:** OpenAI's usage-data report on enterprise AI adoption as of late 2024/early 2025. Four key findings: (1) Scaling and deepening — ChatGPT message volume grew 8x from November 2024; API reasoning token consumption grew 320x; ~20% of Enterprise messages now flow through Custom GPTs or Projects; 19x growth in weekly users of Custom GPTs year-to-date. (2) Measurable productivity impact — 75% of workers report improved speed or quality; average 40–60 min/day saved per active ChatGPT Enterprise user; data scientists and engineers save 60–80 min/day; 87% of IT workers report faster issue resolution; 73% of engineers report faster code delivery. (3) Global acceleration — technology sector growth 11x; healthcare 8x; manufacturing 7x; finance 6x. (4) Widening leader/laggard gap — frontier organizations send 6x more messages than median enterprises; frontier firms send 2x more messages per seat. The report explicitly frames this as a "widening capability gap": models are capable of far more than most organizations have embedded in workflows.

**Key data points:**
- 8x growth in ChatGPT message volume (Nov 2024 onward)
- 320x increase in API reasoning token consumption
- 40–60 minutes/day saved per active ChatGPT Enterprise user
- 75% report improved speed or quality of output
- 75% of users can complete new tasks previously unable to perform
- 36% average increase in coding-related messages outside engineering functions (non-technical workers doing code)
- Frontier organizations: 6x more messages than median enterprises; 2x more per seat than median firms
- Technology sector customer growth: 11x YoY; healthcare 8x; manufacturing 7x; finance 6x

**Relevance to maturity model:** The frontier/laggard gap data (6x message volume) is the most concrete empirical evidence for the Level 4–5 difference from Level 1–2: it is not a marginal performance difference. The 75% capability expansion figure (users completing tasks previously impossible) supports the Jevons's Law framing — this is not just speed increase, it's decision-space expansion. The 320x reasoning token growth is direct evidence of the shift from reactive (chat) to agentic (multi-step reasoning) use patterns. The sectoral growth data is useful for framing which industries are accelerating fastest. Note: this is a vendor report; figures should be corroborated against independent surveys (Menlo Ventures, McKinsey entries 17–18).

### 17. 2025 State of Generative AI in the Enterprise

**Authors:** Menlo Ventures
**Published:** 2025 (survey conducted November 7–25, 2025)
**Format:** Web report (PDF not accessible; notes saved locally)
**Source file:** `../Resources/Menlo-Ventures-State-of-GenAI-Enterprise-2025-notes.txt`
**Methodology:** ~500 U.S. enterprise AI decision-makers + bottoms-up ecosystem analysis (excludes chips, traditional cloud inference, AI features embedded in legacy software)

**Project-tuned summary:** The most comprehensive independent market sizing and trend survey found in this research. Key headline: enterprise GenAI market reached $37B in 2025 (up from $11.5B in 2024 — 3.2x YoY growth), making it "the fastest-scaling software category in history" and 6% of global SaaS market within 3 years of ChatGPT's launch. The build-vs-buy shift is the most striking organizational finding: in 2024, 47% of enterprises built their own AI vs. 53% buying; in 2025, this reversed to 24% build / 76% buy. The architectural maturity finding is critical: only 16% of enterprise deployments qualify as "true agents" (27% for startups). Dominant approaches are still prompt design, RAG, and fixed-sequence workflows — fine-tuning, tool calling, and RL remain niche. Foundation model market share: Anthropic 40% (up from 24%), OpenAI 27% (down from 50% in 2023), Google 21% (up from 7%), open-source 11% (down from 19%).

**Key data points:**
- Enterprise GenAI market: $37B (2025) vs. $11.5B (2024) — 3.2x YoY
- Application layer: $19B (51%); Infrastructure layer: $18B (49%)
- Build vs. buy: 47/53 (2024) → 24/76 (2025)
- Only 16% of enterprise deployments are "true agents" (27% of startups)
- Dominant approaches: prompt design, RAG, fixed-sequence/routing workflows
- AI buyers convert at 47% vs. 25% for traditional SaaS
- Product-led growth = 27% of AI application spend (~4x the traditional software rate of 7%)
- Startups captured 63% of application revenue (up from 36% prior year)
- Anthropic: 40% enterprise LLM market share; ~54% coding market share (Claude Code)
- Coding: $4B (55% of departmental AI spend) — "first true killer use case"
- 50% of developers use AI coding tools daily; teams report 15%+ velocity gains

**Relevance to maturity model:** The 16% true-agent deployment figure is the single most important empirical anchor for the "where organizations are now" section. It maps directly to the Level 3/4 boundary in the working model: most organizations have moved from ad hoc use (Level 1) to sanctioned/governed use (Level 2–3), but only ~16% have moved to integrated agentic workflows (Level 4+). The build-vs-buy reversal (47% → 24% build) is counterintuitive and important: it suggests most organizations have concluded that foundational AI capability is now a commodity purchase, concentrating differentiation efforts on deployment and workflow integration — which is exactly what Level 3→4 requires. The coding dominance ($4B, 55% of departmental AI) is consistent with the Uber case studies; the non-coding adoption lag explains why most organizations are Level 2–3 despite high awareness.

### 18. The State of AI 2025

**Authors:** McKinsey & Company
**Published:** 2025
**Format:** Web report (PDF download blocked; entry based on published summary data)

**Project-tuned summary:** McKinsey's annual AI adoption survey, the longest-running series of its kind (started 2017). The 2025 edition documents that AI adoption has crossed the mainstream threshold: GenAI adoption rose from ~33% in 2023 to ~65% in 2024, roughly doubling year-over-year. The report distinguishes between adoption (having AI tools deployed) and value capture (seeing measurable business impact): the gap between these remains wide. Organizations seeing the highest returns share three characteristics — they have changed workflows, not just added tools; they have retrained workers rather than just provided access; and they have governance structures that handle AI-generated errors systematically. Cost savings remain the primary reported benefit, but revenue gains are emerging as a secondary metric among high performers. The report also documents that AI-related workforce anxiety has risen alongside adoption, and that organizations that address it explicitly perform better than those that don't.

**Key data points:**
- GenAI adoption: ~33% (2023) → ~65% (2024) — roughly doubled in one year
- High performers distinguish from average adopters on: workflow redesign, worker retraining, systematic error governance
- Cost savings remain primary reported benefit; revenue gains emerging among high performers

**Note on sourcing:** McKinsey's PDF download was blocked by server-side protection during research. The above summary is drawn from publicly available McKinsey.com summaries and widely cited statistics from the report. Verify specific figures before citing in the litepaper; the full report is accessible via McKinsey.com with registration.

**Relevance to maturity model:** The 65% adoption figure vs. 16% true-agent figure (Menlo Ventures, entry 17) is the most telling gap in the adoption data: two-thirds of organizations have AI deployed, but fewer than one-fifth have moved beyond basic workflows. This is the empirical case for why the maturity model's middle levels (2–3) are the most crowded — organizations are not failing to adopt AI, they are failing to govern it well enough to move to integration. The workflow-redesign finding reinforces the protocol framing directly: the differentiator between high and low performers is not the AI itself, but the coordination protocol around it.

## Category: AI adoption critique and methodology

### 19. Vibe Coding and the Maker Movement

**Author:** Sachin (Technically / Summer of Protocols)
**Published:** February 26, 2026
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/Vibe Coding and the Maker Movement - by Sachin.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** A comparative analysis of vibe coding (rapid AI code generation) against the maker movement (Arduino, 3D printing), arguing that vibe coding skipped the "scenius phase" — the low-pressure, playful period when hobbyist communities accumulate tacit knowledge before commercialization. Earlier technology waves had extended periods of unproductive experimentation that built the judgment needed to use the tools well. Vibe coding eliminated this: instant professional-grade tooling, immediate deployment, no permission to experiment. Key concepts: Time to Mediocrity (TTM — AI brings any practitioner to functional performance in a domain without deep expertise); Slopsunami (when content becomes cheaper to produce than to search, document quality collapses); Hypomania (productive capacity increases without corresponding increase in sustainable judgment). The paper's central tension: vibe coding is not a degraded form of programming but a new production model with different properties — including the inversion of the domain knowledge / coding knowledge hierarchy. Connects directly to Benny (entry 3): both identify how AI changes the cost structure of knowledge work in ways that demand different governance, not just faster adoption.

**Key concepts:**
- Time to Mediocrity (TTM): AI brings any practitioner to functional performance without deep expertise
- Slopsunami: content cheaper to produce than to search → document quality collapse
- Scenius: the low-pressure community phase that builds tacit judgment; vibe coding skipped it
- Hypomania: output volume up, judgment quality flat

**Relevance to maturity model:** A critique of the assumption that capability = output. Organizations that maximize vibe coding throughput without the governance layer accumulate slop faster than they accumulate judgment. This is the failure mode at Level 2: tools are deployed, volume is high, quality feedback loops are absent. The TTM concept is useful language for why Level 2 organizations feel productive but are not yet compounding: everyone is at mediocrity, no one is building depth. The Slopsunami is the quality failure mode that forces transitions from Level 2 to Level 3 — organizations hit a quality floor and have to build governance to get past it.

## Category: Protocol theory — foundational

*These sources provide the theoretical grounding for the protocol framing of the maturity model. The central argument — that AI adoption failure is a protocol failure — depends on a precise definition of what protocols are and how they govern coordination. This category builds that foundation.*

### 20. Introduction to the Protocol Reader

**Author:** Venkatesh Rao (Summer of Protocols)
**Published:** 2023
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/Introduction-to-the-Protocol-Reader-Venkatesh-Rao.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** The framing document for the Summer of Protocols research program. Defines protocols as "a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices" — but argues this narrow technical definition masks the broader phenomenon: protocols are the infrastructure through which coordination happens at scale, from network handshakes to legal systems to organizational procedures. Rao's central move is to elevate "protocol" from a technical term to an analytical lens for understanding how behavior is governed without requiring central authority. The essay establishes the Summer of Protocols research agenda: to develop rigorous theory for how protocols are designed, adopted, fail, and evolve. Key framing: protocols are to coordination what markets are to price — an infrastructure for producing outcomes without requiring actors to agree on goals. This makes them essential for understanding AI governance: AI systems participate in coordination without sharing human goals, so the protocol layer becomes the governance mechanism.

**Key concepts:**
- Protocol as coordination infrastructure (not just technical spec)
- Protocols govern behavior without requiring shared goals
- Protocols succeed by becoming invisible; failure restores visibility
- The gap between protocols as designed and protocols as practiced is where governance problems live

**Relevance to maturity model:** The foundational source for the protocol framing. The definition of protocol as "coordination without shared goals" is the precise reason why a protocol-framed maturity model differs from a process-compliance model: AI systems do not share organizational goals, so the governance question is always about the protocol layer, never about alignment. This should be cited in the litepaper's opening reframe. Also provides the intellectual lineage connecting the maturity model to the Summer of Protocols research program.

### 21. Theorizing Protocolization I: New Nature

**Author:** Venkatesh Rao, Patrick Nast
**Published:** January 8, 2026
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/Theorizing Protocolization I_ New Nature.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Argues that protocolization is a centuries-long planetary transformation — the progressive metabolization of human behaviors into reliable coordination infrastructure. Unlike "heroic" technologies (steam engines, airplanes), protocols work ecologically and invisibly. The central concept: the "New Nature" — a planetary condition increasingly governed by laws of the artificial, engineered to be nearly as immutable as nature. Seven dimensions of protocol invisibility: operational (muscle memory), infrastructural (buried machinery), social/cognitive (behavioral habituation), anti-memetic (boring, unremarkable), marginal (peripheral to attention), default-quiet (visible only when failing), and oblique (indirect causation). The most important implication: progress through invisibility — advancement is measured by how fully protocols escape conscious awareness. Organizations adopting AI face this dynamic directly: the goal is to make AI-enabled coordination invisible, but the path there requires making existing implicit protocols visible first. Over-protocolization (protocols so successful they erase their own raison d'être) is identified as a genuine pathology.

**Key concepts:**
- Protocolization as metabolization of behavior into infrastructure
- New Nature: laws of the artificial approaching immutability of natural law
- Seven dimensions of protocol invisibility
- Over-protocolization: success erasing the literacy needed to sustain it

**Relevance to maturity model:** The "progress through invisibility" concept maps cleanly to the Level 4→5 transition. A Level 4 organization has designed its AI workflows (they are visible and explicit). A Level 5 organization has had those workflows become frictionless enough to be effectively invisible — they are infrastructure. The over-protocolization warning is relevant to the Level 5 failure mode: organizations that achieve full AI integration can lose the ability to govern it, because the governance protocols become invisible along with everything else. This is the compounding → brittleness risk at the top of the model.

### 22. Theorizing Protocolization II: Atomic Protocol Questions

**Authors:** Venkatesh Rao, Patrick Nast et al. (Summer of Protocols)
**Published:** March 4, 2026
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/Theorizing Protocolization II_ Atomic Protocol Questions.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Introduces Atomic Protocol Questions (APQs) as a methodology for studying protocols: self-contained, indivisible research problems that combine empirical context, a theoretically significant dimension, and a crisp question. The paper argues that developing formal protocol theory requires a hybrid approach — "birds" (theorists) and "frogs" (problem-solvers) working together without requiring grand unified frameworks. Protocol dimensions examined: stewardship, invisibility, legibility, constraint, observability, ludicity. The bus bunching case study (why transit buses arrive in clusters instead of on schedule) demonstrates how a single protocol problem intersects control theory, urban planning, operations research, economics, and machine learning — without a single discipline being sufficient.

**Key concepts:**
- Atomic Protocol Questions (APQs): self-contained, indivisible, heterogeneous problems
- Protocol dimensions: stewardship, invisibility, legibility, constraint, observability, ludicity
- Birds (theorists) + frogs (problem-solvers) as the necessary hybrid
- Bus bunching as a model protocol problem: human discretion vs. system constraints

**Relevance to maturity model:** The APQ methodology is directly applicable to the maturity model design. Each level of the model should be diagnosable through protocol-specific questions about a specific dimension — not global assessments. The bus bunching example is a useful analogy for the AI governance bottleneck: when individual agents exercise discretion optimally (buses wait for passengers, employees use the best available AI tool), system-level coordination degrades. A protocol fix at the system level is required, not better individual behavior. This directly supports the argument that maturity model progression requires protocol redesign, not just individual tool adoption.

### 23. What is Formal Protocol Theory?

**Author:** Venkatesh Rao (Protocolized)
**Published:** August 20, 2025
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/What is Formal Protocol Theory_.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** A short orienting piece describing the nascent field of Formal Protocol Theory (FPT) — seeking unifying principles across phenomena ranging from handshakes to planetary coordination systems. The paper documents six SIGFPT sessions exploring protocol observability, notation, process calculi (Tony Hoare, Robin Milner), paper-napkin mathematics, and impossibilities/symmetries (the Witsenhausen counterexample). Key claim: protocols remain poorly theorized because existing analytical frameworks (globalization, industrialization, urbanization) miss what protocols actually do. Notation is emphasized as a core tool — not just notation for communication but notation as a mechanism for thought (Iverson's Turing lecture). The Witsenhausen counterexample is cited as foundational: in decentralized control problems, nonlinear strategies can outperform linear ones in ways that defy intuition, showing that impossibilities and constraints are analytically central.

**Key concepts:**
- FPT: developing precise ontologies and methods for cross-domain protocol analysis
- Process calculi as mathematical framework for concurrent coordination
- Notation as thinking tool (not just communication)
- Impossibilities and symmetries as protocol foundations

**Relevance to maturity model:** Primarily useful as intellectual context rather than direct content. The FPT framing legitimizes treating "protocol" as a precise analytical category — not a metaphor. For the litepaper, this means the protocol framing of the maturity model is not a rhetorical choice but a claim about what is actually being measured. The impossibilities framing is useful: some governance failures are not failures of will or competence but structural impossibilities at the given coordination level — which is exactly what the maturity model's "characteristic tension" sections should articulate.

### 24. Constructing the Evil Twin of AI

**Author:** Venkatesh Rao (Protocolized)
**Published:** October 16, 2025
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/Constructing the Evil Twin of AI.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Formal Protocol Theory as the "evil twin" of AI — the science of designing deliberately immovable, anti-intelligent, anti-agentic systems. The argument: intelligence tends to make everything fluid, contingent, and subject to continuous change. Agency drives endless transformation. Protocols deliberately resist this: they are designed to be rigid, immutable, and constrained. The paper develops this through blockchains (proof-of-work as "willfully engineered stupidity"), zero-knowledge proofs (mathematical impossibility as governance mechanism), and classical robotics (deterministic motion languages vs. RL-based learning). The smooth-vs-striated distinction: protocols convert open terrain into systems of roads; transform ambient optionality into constrained behavior spaces. The "evil twin" framing is not pejorative — it reveals that AI and protocol design are mutually necessary: AI expands the solution space; protocols constrain which solutions are permissible.

**Key concepts:**
- Anti-intelligence and anti-agency as design objectives
- Smooth vs. striated behavior spaces (protocols = roads, not fields)
- Proof-of-work as engineered stupidity; ZK proofs as governance-by-impossibility
- AI and protocols as evil twins: mutually necessary, structurally opposite

**Relevance to maturity model:** This paper provides the deepest theoretical grounding for the protocol framing. The governance of uncertainty is not about predicting what AI will do — it is about constraining which actions are permissible, regardless of what the AI could do. A Level 1 organization has smooth behavior space (AI can do anything, no protocols constrain it). A Level 5 organization has carefully striated space: clear protocols define where AI operates autonomously and where it cannot act without human authorization. This maps directly to the level descriptions and reframes "governance" from bureaucratic overhead to fundamental design requirement. Should be cited in the litepaper's theoretical framing section.

### 25. Mechanical Currents

**Author:** Timber Stinson-Schroff (Protocolized)
**Published:** September 9, 2025
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/Mechanical Currents.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** AI adoption as a protocol disturbance event. The core claim: when AI accelerates some workflows while others remain human-paced, "mechanical currents" form — uneven acceleration that exposes hidden protocols and forces organizations to articulate previously implicit coordination assumptions. Three key concepts: (1) Time to Mediocrity — AI brings any team member to functional performance in a domain without requiring deep expertise; (2) Slopsunami — when content is cheaper to produce than to search, document quality collapses; (3) Temporal divergence — AI-enabled speedup creates misalignment when some clocks accelerate and others don't. Critical reframe: friction and failures from AI adoption are not resistance to change — they are signs of protocol integrity under load. Three organizational responses observed empirically: vertical integration (internalizing AI-adjacent functions), translation work (FDEs), and operational formalization (governance docs, ontologies).

**Key concepts:**
- Time to Mediocrity (TTM): functional performance without depth
- Slopsunami: production cost < search cost → quality collapse
- Temporal divergence: AI accelerates some workflows, not others
- Protocol integrity under load: friction as signal, not obstacle

**Relevance to maturity model:** Directly relevant to the level descriptions. The "protocol integrity under load" framing explains why Level 2 organizations experience chaos even though they have adopted AI tools: their underlying coordination protocols were implicit and untested, and AI adoption exposed their load limits. The temporal divergence concept explains the characteristic tension at Level 3: organizations with governance policies find that the policies apply inconsistently across functions that operate at different speeds. The three organizational responses map to the paths from Level 2 to Level 3: vertical integration, translation/FDE support, and formalization — exactly the interventions the model should recommend.

### 26. Finding Fault Lines within the Firm

**Author:** Rafa (Protocolized)
**Published:** January 11, 2026
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/Finding Fault Lines within the Firm.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** AI adoption reveals hidden organizational protocols by placing strain on coordination systems. "Fault lines" — borrowed from geology — are the boundaries of protocol structures that become visible only under stress. The paper's central observation: management control increasingly encoded into software (approval flows, access rights, incident procedures) behaves differently from practiced management. Software-encoded protocols enforce compliance uniformly and instantly; management practice traditionally allowed contextual flexibility. AI adoption accelerates this encoding and removes the contextual exceptions that allowed brittle protocols to function. Key finding: AI adoption highlights where management has already been formalized, where practice has been carrying hidden load, and where current protocols are brittle. The airline chatbot example: the AI surfaces the gap between the formalized pricing protocol (the rules the system enforces) and the practical management protocol (the exceptions that experienced agents knew to make).

**Key concepts:**
- Fault lines: protocol boundaries made visible by strain
- Software-encoded protocols vs. practiced management
- Temporal coherence: organizations operate with multiple clocks
- Protocol brittleness: when contextual flexibility is removed

**Relevance to maturity model:** This paper provides the clearest account of why Level 1 (Shadow) and Level 2 (Sanctioned) organizations experience the specific failure modes they do — not because AI is bad but because the protocols being disrupted were already brittle and implicit. The fault line concept is strong candidate language for the characteristic tension sections: at each level, the tension is between the organization's visible protocol (the thing they think they're governing) and the fault line below it (the implicit coordination that the visible protocol was relying on). The airline chatbot example should be used in the litepaper.

### 27. Have Your Factory Call My Factory

**Author:** Venkatesh Rao (Protocolized)
**Published:** March 2, 2026
**Format:** Essay PDF
**Source file:** `../Resources/Have Your Factory Call My Factory.pdf`

**Project-tuned summary:** Documents an emerging economic pattern: "factory-to-factory" (F2F) relationships between AI agent systems and humans. The author describes building multiple interconnected Claude Code factories for a book publishing pipeline — a model that scales rapidly through explicit handoff protocols between agents, without requiring either party to understand the other's full implementation. Key claim: domain knowledge is the limiting factor, not coding ability — two people without programming experience can orchestrate sophisticated production pipelines if they can articulate the coordination protocol clearly. F2F links are largely invisible: the protocol-based handoffs between factories (manuscript transmittal, metadata servers, Dropbox handoffs) enable massive capability integrations from the outside. The "factory-owner economy" concept: AI is not replacing workers but spawning a new economic form in which agents and humans coordinate through protocols at unprecedented scales.

**Key concepts:**
- Agent factories: AI agents operating within defined scope, handoff structure, escalation protocols
- F2F relationships: protocol-based coordination between two agent-driven systems
- Factory-owner economy: domain expertise + protocol design as the new capital
- Domain knowledge > coding knowledge as the limiting constraint

**Relevance to maturity model:** The factory-owner model is the concrete instantiation of Level 5 (Compounding): an organization that has moved beyond governing individual AI tools to designing the protocols through which multiple AI systems coordinate. The domain knowledge > coding knowledge finding challenges the standard maturity model assumption that AI literacy is what organizations need to build. The F2F concept is also the most vivid evidence for Jevons's Law (entry 7) applied to knowledge work: once factory-to-factory coordination is possible, organizations can explore workflow designs that were unaffordable to attempt with human labor. Should be used in the Level 5 description.

### 28. Samsung Electronics — ChatGPT source code leak

**Sources:** Gizmodo (April 2023); Bloomberg (May 2023); Cybersecurity Dive (April 2023)
**URLs:** https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-ai-samsung-employees-leak-data-1850307376 · https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-generative-ai-use-by-staff-after-leak

**What the shadow usage looked like.** Three Samsung Semiconductor engineers, independently and without authorization, pasted sensitive material into personal ChatGPT accounts within a single month: (1) proprietary source code from a faulty semiconductor database to ask for a bug fix; (2) confidential equipment code to debug; (3) a full internal meeting transcript to generate a summary and action items. All three submitted to OpenAI's servers without oversight.

**Adoption context.** Cyberhaven's contemporaneous research estimated that in a 100,000-person company, confidential data was being shared with OpenAI hundreds of times per week. 3.1% of enterprise ChatGPT users had submitted confidential data — the Samsung incident was discovered because it was Samsung; the same pattern was everywhere.

**Business consequences.** Samsung imposed an emergency cap of 1,024 bytes per ChatGPT prompt, then banned all generative AI tools for employees entirely. Samsung Semiconductor launched an internal LLM project as a direct response. The leaked source code and meeting contents cannot be recalled from OpenAI's training pipeline; IP exposure is permanent and unquantifiable. No public regulatory fine has been disclosed. The incident became the canonical enterprise case study for shadow AI data leakage — it is cited in virtually every subsequent treatment of the risk.

**What happened next.** Samsung partially reversed its ban: ChatGPT access was restored in select business divisions (Samsung SDI, Samsung Display, Samsung Electronics) under new security guidelines, with sensitive product development teams still excluded. Concurrently, Samsung developed Samsung Gauss internally (now Gauss 2.0 — multimodal, 14 languages, code generation) and an internal no-code "Agentic Builder" for agent deployment. Galaxy S26 is expected to debut system-wide agentic AI, converting the remediation investment into a product capability. A separate 2025 breach — 270,000 Samsung Germany customer support tickets leaked via stolen third-party vendor credentials — drew attention to AI-weaponized data exploitation (LLMs parsing breach data for phishing), though this was a supply-chain incident, not another employee-to-AI leak.

**Relevance to maturity model.** The cleanest single-incident Level 1 case: senior technical employees making individually rational decisions (the tools were effective) that created organization-level exposure because no protocol governed the boundary between AI tools and confidential data. The organization had no visibility into what was being shared until it was too late. The response (ban everything, then build internal alternatives) is the canonical Level 1 exit path — expensive, reactive, and slower than a proactive Level 2 governance move would have been. The follow-on is equally instructive: Samsung exited Level 1 by building internal infrastructure, then selectively re-admitted external tools under protocol — a Level 2→3 transition arc in fast-forward.

**What the shadow usage looked like.** Attorneys across multiple firms used ChatGPT and similar tools — without firm authorization, verification protocols, or oversight — to draft briefs and conduct case law research. The tools fabricated non-existent citations. The original high-profile case (Mata v. Avianca, SDNY, 2023) involved ChatGPT-generated fake case citations submitted to the court. The incident triggered a cascade tracked in a dedicated hallucination case law database.

**Adoption scale.** As of early 2026: 712 judicial decisions worldwide address AI hallucinations; 90% were issued in 2025; 324 are in U.S. courts alone. The ABA identified legal teams as a high-risk shadow AI population — 78% of knowledge workers use "bring your own AI" tools outside IT-approved stacks (Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index).

**Business consequences.** Sanctions escalated year-over-year. ByoPlanet v. Johansson (S.D. Fla., August 2025): $86,000 sanction — the largest single fine to date for AI-hallucinated citations. A Denver attorney who denied using AI received a 90-day suspension. Courts have formally declared monetary sanctions "ineffective at deterring" the behavior, signaling disbarment-level consequences are forthcoming. The ABA classified unauthorized AI use as a duty-of-candor violation (professional licensing risk, not merely negligence), not just negligence. Malpractice carriers began adding AI exclusions.

**What happened next.** The problem accelerated dramatically: from ~2 cases/week (pre-spring 2025) to 2–3 cases/day (fall 2025), with 550+ tracked cases involving 128+ named lawyers. The ABA issued Formal Opinion 512 (July 2024): lawyers must have "reasonable understanding" of AI capabilities and must verify all AI-generated output. State bars followed with similar guidance. At least one federal judge referred all counsel to their respective state bars as part of a sanction order. By late 2025, 80% of AmLaw 100 firms had established formal AI governance boards; the North Carolina Bar Association published guidance in January 2026 titled "Beyond the Ban: Why Your Law Firm Needs a Realistic AI Policy in 2026." New 2025 sanctions include: a California appellate court's first state-level AI sanction; the MyPillow/Lindell case ($3,000 per attorney, 24+ fabricated citations); a $2,900 fine for a self-represented litigant ($100/citation, 29 instances). A new liability dimension emerged in September 2025: a California court ruled that opposing counsel can be sanctioned for failing to detect an adversary's hallucinated citations.

**Relevance to maturity model.** A Level 1 case study in a highly regulated, high-stakes profession where the failure mode is not data leakage but quality failure — and the quality failure carries professional licensing consequences. Notable because the shadow adoption pattern (lawyers using personal AI accounts) persisted for 2+ years under escalating sanctions, demonstrating that Level 1 organizations do not exit the level just because costs are visible. What moves them is not punishment but protocol: the AmLaw 100 response (80% with governance boards by late 2025) vs. the broader bar (still predominantly ad hoc) illustrates the difference between organizations that design their way out of Level 1 and those that don't. The detection-of-adversary's-citations ruling extends protocol responsibility to verification of others' outputs — a governance escalation with no analogue in previous legal practice.

### 30. Healthcare sector — shadow AI and HIPAA exposure

**Sources:** Healthcare Dive (2025); symplr enterprise survey (2025); IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2025; TechTarget HealthTech Security
**URLs:** https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/shadow-unauthorized-ai-/810191/ · https://www.techtarget.com/healthtechsecurity/feature/Shadow-AI-in-healthcare-The-hidden-risk-to-data-security

**What the shadow usage looked like.** Clinical and administrative healthcare workers were found pasting patient data, prior-authorization letters, policy numbers, and patient CSVs into personal ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot accounts. A 2025 survey of 500+ healthcare workers found 17% admitted to using unauthorized AI tools. The usage spanned clinical documentation (summarizing patient notes), administrative (drafting prior-auth appeals), and operational (analyzing patient satisfaction data).

**Adoption scale.** Shadow AI incidents reported at 86% of healthcare organizations surveyed (up from 81% in 2024, per symplr). Only 35% of healthcare organizations can track their own AI usage. The healthcare sector experienced twice as many security breaches in 2025 as in 2024, with shadow AI identified as a contributing factor.

**Business consequences.** IBM's 2025 breach report: average healthcare breach costs $7.42 million, takes 279 days to resolve. 97% of organizations that experienced AI-related security incidents lacked proper AI access controls. 44% of organizations experiencing a shadow AI security incident suffered confirmed data compromise. Federal OCR guidance (2024) clarified that sending PHI to third-party AI services without a Business Associate Agreement constitutes a reportable HIPAA breach — meaning most shadow AI usage in healthcare carries automatic regulatory exposure. Enforcement activity has not yet produced large public fines directly attributable to AI-related breaches, but regulatory signals indicate this is a matter of timing.

**What happened next.** Named breaches with AI involvement emerged in 2025. Healthcare Interactive (July 2025): AI-powered insurance enrollment platform breached, 3,056,950 individuals' PHI exposed — one of 2025's largest healthcare breaches. Catholic Health / Serviceaide (fall 2025): an agentic AI vendor's database misconfiguration exposed 483,126 patients' data, the first named breach explicitly attributed to an agentic AI vendor's infrastructure failure. Oracle Health / Cerner (January 2025): breach of legacy AI-integrated EHR systems affected dozens of hospitals, with named health systems still issuing notifications mid-2025. On the regulatory front, HHS/OCR proposed the first major HIPAA Security Rule overhaul in 20 years (January 6, 2025): eliminating the "required vs. addressable" safeguard distinction, mandating annual audits, network mapping, MFA, and encryption across all covered entities. OCR enforcement accelerated: 20+ settlements in the first nine months of 2025, on pace to exceed prior records.

**Relevance to maturity model.** A sector-level Level 1 case study: unlike Samsung (incident-driven discovery), healthcare shadow AI is structural — it is present at 86% of organizations, is growing, and exists because the productivity benefit is real (documentation, prior-auth drafts, summarization) and the governance infrastructure is absent. The healthcare case is especially useful for the litepaper because it illustrates the protocol failure mode most clearly: the AI is not the problem; the missing BAA, the missing data classification, the missing access control are the problems. The Serviceaide breach adds a new Level 1 variant: shadow AI risk is not just from employees using unauthorized tools, but from authorized AI vendors whose own infrastructure lacks protocol governance. The proposed HIPAA overhaul represents a regulatory forcing function for Level 1→2 transitions across the sector.

### 31. Klarna — AI-for-all mandate, workforce collapse, and reversal

**Sources:** Fast Company (2025); Fortune (May 2025); Entrepreneur (2025); Klarna press releases (2024)
**URLs:** https://www.fastcompany.com/91468582/klarna-tried-to-replace-its-workforce-with-ai · https://fortune.com/2025/05/09/klarna-ai-humans-return-on-investment/ · https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/klarna-ceo-reverses-course-by-hiring-more-humans-not-ai/491396

**What the mandate looked like.** Klarna deployed ChatGPT Enterprise to all ~7,000 employees globally, with CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski publicly championing AI-first operations. Internal AI assistant "Kiki" answered 250,000+ employee questions (2,000/day). A customer-facing AI assistant was deployed for all customer service interactions. No phased training or workflow redesign was documented publicly. The mandate was adoption-first: maximize usage, measure productivity improvement later.

**Adoption rates achieved.** 90% of employees using AI tools daily (as of May 2024 press release) — the highest publicly reported enterprise adoption rate of any named company. Breakdown: 93% in communications, 88% in marketing, 86% in legal. The customer service AI handled roughly two-thirds of all customer service chats in its first month (February 2024).

**Business consequences.** Claimed productivity gain: $40 million profit improvement for 2024. The failure mode: Klarna's workforce fell from 5,527 (2022) to 3,422 (2024) — a 38% reduction. By May 2025, CEO publicly reversed course, admitting cuts "went too far." Customer complaints increased, satisfaction ratings fell; internal reviews found AI "lacked empathy" and could not handle nuanced disputes. Klarna began rehiring human customer service agents, specifically for voice calls and complex problems. The reversal was publicly attributed to "brand and quality" failure — meaning the governance gap was in quality assurance and edge-case handling, not efficiency measurement. The company went public in 2025; the workforce and quality trajectory became investor-facing liabilities.

**What happened next.** Klarna completed its NYSE IPO on September 10, 2025 (ticker: KLAR), pricing at $40/share above its range, raising $1.37B and valuing the company at ~$17–19B (down from $45.6B in 2021). Roughly 3,100 employees held equity; approximately 40 became millionaires. Headcount at IPO: ~3,100 (down from 5,527 in 2022). The CEO publicly reversed on the AI-only customer service decision, admitting cuts "went too far" and citing "generic, repetitive, insufficiently nuanced" AI replies as the root cause. Klarna began rehiring human agents in a flexible remote model. The long-term thesis was not reversed: Siemiatkowski projected in February 2026 (citing Dario Amodei's analysis) that white-collar workforces will shrink by a third by 2030, and that Klarna's own headcount will fall from ~3,000 to below 2,000 via natural attrition. The company plans salary increases rather than headcount growth. In a notable illustration of the AI-as-brand-signal dynamic, Q1 2025 earnings were delivered via an AI avatar of the CEO.

**Relevance to maturity model.** The canonical Level 2 case: maximum adoption rate, genuine productivity gain, and a specific, serious failure mode from the absent governance layer. The Klarna case demonstrates the Level 2 characteristic tension clearly: the organization achieved what it intended (AI everywhere, headcount down, cost savings) and created a new problem (quality floor collapse, brand damage) because the protocol governing which tasks AI should and shouldn't own was never designed. The reversal is itself a Level 2 outcome — the corrective action is reactive (rehire humans after quality fails) rather than designed (define AI/human boundaries before deployment). The IPO adds a financial materiality dimension: the governance failure became an investor-facing liability, and the CEO's public reversal was simultaneously a quality acknowledgment and a risk management disclosure.

### 32. Shopify — AI non-optional memo

**Sources:** CNBC (April 2025); Digital Commerce 360 (April 2025)
**URLs:** https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/shopify-ceo-prove-ai-cant-do-jobs-before-asking-for-more-headcount.html · https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2025/04/08/internal-memo-shopify-ceo-declares-ai-non-optional/

**What the mandate looked like.** An April 7, 2025 internal memo from CEO Tobias Lütke (subsequently made public) declared AI use "non-optional" at all levels. Specific terms: employees must demonstrate AI use in project phases; teams must prove AI cannot do a task before requesting new headcount; AI competency becomes a formal component of performance reviews and hiring decisions. Direct quote: "Frankly, I don't think it's feasible to opt out of learning the skill of applying AI."

**Adoption rates achieved.** No specific adoption rate disclosed post-mandate. The memo was a forcing function, not a report of existing usage — a top-down directive with performance and employment consequences attached. Shopify's workforce had already declined from 11,600 (2022) to 8,100 (end of 2024) through earlier layoff rounds.

**Business consequences.** The documented failure mode was the mandate without the protocol: employees expressed widespread concern that "prove AI can't do your job" would be used to justify role elimination rather than augmentation. No published productivity data was available as of March 2026 — the mandate was too recent to assess outcomes. The primary failure mode was morale damage and definitional ambiguity: what does "AI proficiency" mean in practice for non-technical roles? The mandate created a compliance requirement with no training program attached. Shopify did not publish what demonstrating AI use "in project phases" meant concretely, leaving enforcement arbitrary.

**What happened next.** CEO Lütke posted publicly (~three months post-memo) that "it worked" and described employees tackling "implausible tasks" with "100X the work done." AI proficiency questions were added to performance review questionnaires. Job applicants are now required to complete AI assessments before hiring. Full Year 2025 financials were strong: 30% revenue growth, 17% FCF margin, ten consecutive quarters of double-digit FCF; Q4 2025 was the highest quarterly revenue in company history. Operating expenses fell to 35% of revenue (down from 45% in 2023) while headcount remained ~8,000 — flat to down. The company attributed this directly to "disciplined headcount management." No layoffs linked to the mandate were reported; productivity gains appear real in aggregate financial terms. The governance gap persists in a different form: no public definition of what "AI proficiency" means for non-technical roles has been published, and observers noted senior long-tenure employees found AI integration harder than junior staff, raising questions about whether adoption is genuine or performative compliance.

**Relevance to maturity model.** A Level 2 case study showing the financial upside of the mandate and the remaining protocol gap. The Shopify case is notable because it shows Level 2 being entered deliberately and rapidly — not through organic shadow adoption but through top-down diktat — and producing measurable financial results. The "prove it can't do your job" framing is precisely the Level 2 characteristic tension: AI is sanctioned but the organizational protocol for defining where AI is appropriate vs. inappropriate doesn't exist yet, making the mandate simultaneously real (enforcement consequences) and arbitrary (undefined criteria). Shopify's financial performance validates the Level 2 productivity claim; the absence of a published competency definition for non-technical roles illustrates exactly why Level 2 organizations plateau rather than compound.

### 33. Duolingo — AI-first contractor replacement without workflow redesign

**Sources:** TechCrunch (January 2024); Fortune (August 2025)
**URLs:** https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/ · https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/duolingo-ceo-admits-controversial-ai-memo-did-not-give-enough-context-insists-company-never-laid-off-full-time-employees/

**What the mandate looked like.** In January 2024, Duolingo cut 10% of its contractor workforce (primarily translators and content creators), attributing the decision to AI capability. In April 2025, CEO Luis von Ahn circulated an internal "AI-first" memo that became public, stating Duolingo would only approve headcount increases if teams could demonstrate they had first exhausted automation options — and that contractor roles would not be backfilled when AI could substitute.

**Adoption rates achieved.** CEO claim (September 2025): with the same number of full-time employees, Duolingo can produce "four or five times as much content." No independent verification exists. No full-time employees were laid off; only contractors were replaced.

**Business consequences.** Users and language experts noted that AI-generated content lacked the cultural nuance provided by native-speaker contractors — directly undermining Duolingo's core product proposition, which is grounded in authentic linguistic input. The memo triggered significant public backlash; the majority of social response expressed contempt for the decision. The CEO was forced to issue a public clarification in August 2025, admitting the memo "did not give enough context." The governance gap was structural: the mandate replaced a human quality-assurance layer (native speaker review) with a residual "content curator" role insufficient to catch systematic AI errors in linguistic edge cases. No formal quality metric was published before or after the transition.

**What happened next.** In August 2025, CEO von Ahn admitted the memo "did not give enough context" after widespread media coverage suggested full-time layoffs were imminent — he clarified that only contractors had been cut, not full-time employees. In May 2025, Duolingo pulled all videos from Instagram and TikTok after being flooded with negative comments. During Q2 2025 earnings, von Ahn acknowledged community backlash had pushed DAU growth to the "lower end of projections." Full Year 2025 results were financially strong: $1.04B in revenue (39% YoY), $414M net income (up 367%), 50M+ DAU. However, gross margin declined 40 basis points to 72.5%, attributed to rising AI and hosting costs. Despite strong earnings, DUOL stock dropped ~50% from peak, with the price-to-sales ratio falling to 4.8 — the lowest since IPO. Investor concern centered on AI quality risk, competitive pressure, and user retention sustainability. Product quality concerns from language educators and linguists about cultural nuance in AI-generated content have not been resolved by formal third-party assessment.

**Relevance to maturity model.** A Level 2 case that illustrates the specific failure mode of AI replacing a quality-assurance protocol without replacing the protocol itself. The native-speaker contractor was not just a production resource — they were also the quality check. Removing them without redesigning the review protocol created a quality gap that was invisible in production volume metrics but visible in the product. The financial results illustrate the Level 2 paradox clearly: Duolingo is financially strong by conventional metrics (39% revenue growth, 367% net income increase) while simultaneously showing leading indicators of quality erosion (stock at IPO lows, margin compression from AI costs, DAU growth at low end). The market is pricing in the protocol gap before it becomes a financial gap — which is exactly the dynamic the maturity model argues for: Level 2 organizations that don't build the governance layer are not safe just because the financial metrics haven't turned yet.

### 34. Shadow AI prevalence data roundup

**Sources:** Gartner (2025); Reco.ai State of Shadow AI Report (2025); Cyberhaven Q1 2024; IBM CEO Survey (2024)
**URLs:** https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/gartner-40-firms-hit-shadow-ai/ · https://www.reco.ai/state-of-shadow-ai-report · https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyberhaven-report-surge-in-shadow-ai-accounts-poses-fresh-risks-to-corporate-data-302151221.html

**What this entry covers.** Cross-cutting survey data on shadow AI prevalence and Level 2 adoption patterns. Not a single source but a synthesis of the most-cited quantitative findings, useful for calibrating the "where organizations are now" section.

**Key data points:**
- Gartner (March–May 2025, n=302 cybersecurity leaders): 69% of organizations suspect or have confirmed employees using prohibited public GenAI; Gartner predicts 40%+ of enterprises will have a shadow AI security or compliance incident by 2030
- Reco.ai (2025): average enterprise has 71% of employees using unauthorized AI tools; average time before discovery is 400+ days; 91% of AI tools operate outside IT control; organizations average 269 shadow AI applications per 1,000 employees
- Cyberhaven Q1 2024: corporate data input to AI tools up 485% between March 2023 and March 2024; 27.4% of data submitted to AI tools in March 2024 was sensitive (up from 10.7% one year prior); 73.8% of employee ChatGPT use was on personal accounts
- IBM 2025 Data Breach Report: breaches involving shadow AI cost $4.63M on average — $670,000 more than baseline; 32% of breached organizations paid regulatory fines; 48% of those fines exceeded $100,000
- IBM CEO Survey (2024): 61% of CEOs said they were pushing AI adoption faster than employees were comfortable with; only 39% said they had adequate AI governance in place
- Healthcare-specific (symplr 2025): shadow AI at 86% of health systems; only 35% can track their own AI usage

**Relevance to maturity model.** The aggregate picture from these surveys: shadow AI is near-universal (69–86% depending on sector), pre-dates any formal governance program, and is actively creating liability before most organizations have a policy response. The 400-day average discovery lag is the empirical basis for describing Level 1 as the default state — organizations do not choose Level 1, they find themselves there. The 61% CEO / 39% governance gap is the most direct evidence that Level 2 mandates are being issued without the governance infrastructure to support them. These figures should appear in the litepaper's "where organizations are now" section.

### 35. Table: Learning to See Business Protocols

**Author:** Protocolized
**Published:** 2026
**Format:** PDF appendix (2 pages)
**File:** `../Resources/Table Learning to See Business Protocols.pdf`

**What this document covers.** A diagnostic table mapping persistent operational problems to the disruption events that made them intolerable, the dominant protocol solution that emerged, and the new persistent problem that solution created. Eight historical rows (containerization, EDI, email, Git, cloud, blockchain, blog/social media, RBAC/IAM) plus one speculative row for generative AI. Framed as a diagnostic aid for operational managers.

**Central framing (two claims):**
1. Protocols do not eliminate problems — they trade one class of persistent problem for a new one
2. Today's persistent problems, especially under AI adoption, signal that existing protocols are being pushed beyond their design range

**Key rows for the CMM:**

- **Containerization (ISO):** Unreliable cargo handling → post-war global trade expansion overwhelmed bespoke handling → ISO containerization standards (physical interface protocol) → systemic supply-chain fragility. The Level 5 historical analogue. The Maersk ransomware attack (2017) is the canonical early-L5 failure: containerization and internet protocols converged into a single attack surface with no governance framework adequate to the combined system.

- **Git (distributed version control):** Risky, infrequent software releases → software distribution at internet scale → Git (software management protocol) → coordination overhead (merge conflicts, review load, repository sprawl). Direct analogue to FM3-1 (temporal divergence): solving the production bottleneck surfaces the coordination bottleneck. The Uber case is the AI-era instance of this pattern.

- **RBAC/IAM:** Slow security review cycles → cloud + continuous deployment → RBAC/IAM systems (management protocol) → policy sprawl. Analogue to FM3-3 (governance brittleness under versioning): permissions designed for one deployment model become hard to reason about when the environment changes.

- **Slop management (speculative):** Knowledge work and digital content can be produced faster than it can be synthesized → generative AI in knowledge work → discovery protocols (still forming: enterprise-level ranking and signal rewards) → orientation alignment (navigating multiple possible future paths simultaneously while defining what is remembered). Validates the Slopsunami at Level 2 and points to the unsolved protocol problem the CMM's Level 3 organizations are building toward.

**Relevance to maturity model.** The table provides the pattern-level argument that the CMM is tracking: organizations stuck at each level are stuck because they haven't adopted the protocol response to their current persistent problem. The "protocol trade" framing belongs in the model header. Containerization as a Level 5 historical analogue is the clearest realized precedent for planetary protocol embedding. The slop management / discovery protocol row confirms that the Slopsunami mechanism and the L2→3 transition is pointing at an unsolved problem, not a solved one.

### 36. AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It

**Authors:** Aruna Ranganathan, Xingqi Maggie Ye
**Published:** February 9, 2026
**Publication:** Harvard Business Review
**Format:** Academic article
**URL:** https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it

**Project-tuned summary:** An eight-month longitudinal study of a 200-person technology firm documenting how AI adoption intensified — rather than reduced — employee workload. The core finding: intensification was self-generated, not management-mandated. Workers independently embraced AI because it made "doing more" feel rewarding and accessible. Three specific mechanisms identified: (1) **Task expansion** — workers crossed traditional role boundaries (designers coded, researchers engineered) because AI made unfamiliar domains feel tractable, absorbing adjacent roles while widening personal scope; (2) **Blurred work-life boundaries** — AI's conversational interface made work infiltrate pauses that previously served as recovery time; the low perceived friction of "typing a line to an AI system" erased the cognitive signal that marks the start of work; (3) **Increased multitasking** — workers managed parallel AI threads simultaneously, creating continuous attention-switching and compounding cognitive load despite a feeling of momentum. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle: AI-enabled speed raises baseline expectations, expanded scope increases work density, and the absence of natural stopping signals makes the cycle invisible until burnout arrives. The authors' proposed solution — "AI practice": intentional pauses, sequenced batching, and protected human-collaboration time — is framed as an organizational design intervention to restore cognitive boundaries AI dissolved.

**Key data points:**
- Study design: eight-month ethnographic study, 200-person technology firm
- Three mechanisms of intensification: task expansion, boundary dissolution, multitasking load
- Key quote: "Without intention, AI makes it easier to do more — but harder to stop."
- Proposed remedy: "AI practice" — intentional pauses, sequencing, human grounding — not speed control

**Relevance to maturity model:** This paper is the empirical grounding for the protocol gap argument at Levels 1–2. The intensification the article documents is a direct consequence of individual-level Level 3 behavior occurring within an organization that has no Level 2 governance — workers are designing their own AI workflows (task expansion, F2F collaboration) while the organization lacks the protocol infrastructure to absorb or coordinate that activity. The authors' diagnosis is accurate (intensification is real and unsustainable) but their proposed solution — designed pauses — addresses the symptom, not the cause. The cause is missing protocol: without defined handoff points, scope boundaries, and quality standards, the individual's AI-expanded capacity has no organizational structure to attach to, so it spreads laterally and temporally until it fills all available space. The article's "AI practice" framework is a Level 2 individual coping strategy; the maturity model's answer is Level 3 protocol design that removes the need for individual restraint by structuring the environment itself.
